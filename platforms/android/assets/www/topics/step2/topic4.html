<p><strong>Supply Chain Mapping</strong></p>
<p>Companies know who their direct suppliers are and where they are located. However, in many cases, companies source from vendors or agents who do not disclose the factories or other production facilities from which <em>they</em> in turn source. Oftentimes companies may be aware of the first-tier factories and production facilities in their supply chains, but know little or nothing about the practices of second, third and other tiers of suppliers down the line. Companies should know as much as possible about who supplies to them&mdash;at all levels of the supply chain, including producers of raw materials. The more comprehensively a company can map its supply chains, the more accurately it can identify those places along the chain with the greatest risks of labor abuses. It is therefore important to communicate with your company&rsquo;s sourcing and/or supply chain management teams to obtain data about their own supply chains, and if more information is needed, to work closely with them to supplement that data.</p>
<p>If your company currently does not have access to information about suppliers beyond those from whom you directly source, consider working with the legal department and/or other appropriate units in your company to create contractual requirements for disclosing comprehensive information about all of your suppliers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mapping&rdquo; includes knowing not only who your suppliers are (throughout the supply chain), but also where they are located. This information is essential for risk and impact assessment related to legal and regulatory environments, among other things. This exercise may also include maps showing seasonality of production or production cycles throughout the year, as these may be tied to times of greater risk for labor abuses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following are three examples of supply chain maps:</p>

<p>Goods produced using agricultural or mineral commodities can be particularly difficult to trace, since the raw materials are harvested or mined in widely dispersed geographic areas and aggregated or co-mingled early in the supply chain. Some companies and industry coalitions have attempted &ldquo;traceability&rdquo; programs to track certain commodities from a finished product back through the supply chain to their point of origin.</p>
<p>To be clear, mapping supply chains does not necessarily imply that your company is responsible for all impacts and risks associated with every entity in the chain. As stated in the United Nations <em>Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights</em>, &ldquo;where business enterprises have large numbers of entities in their value chains it may be unreasonably difficult to conduct due diligence for adverse human rights impacts across them all. If so, business enterprises should identify general areas where the risk of adverse human rights impacts is more significant, whether due to certain suppliers&rsquo; or clients&rsquo; operating context, the particular operations, products or services involved, or other relevant considerations, and prioritize those for human rights due diligence.&rdquo; This prioritization process is addressed below.</p>
<p><strong>Cocoa Supply Chains (Cote D'Ivoire and Ghana)</strong></p>
<img src="topics/step2/images/cocoa_supply_chains.png" alt="This graphic illustrates the various players in a cocoa supply chain, which include farmers; collectors/transporters; processors; exporters; the global market; manufacturers (which may also manufacture other beans); customers; and consumers. The graphic also lists examples of entities and activities that fall into those supply chain categories in two countries: C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire and Ghana. In C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire, examples of farmers include small, family farms (&gt;750,000); independent operations; and a few cooperatives (where cocoa is &lt;20% of crop). Collectors and transporters include privately-funded operators; and pisteurs, traitants; which have fewer quality linkages. Processors and exporters include various participants, including international companies. This includes those that produce semi-finished goods. In Ghana, examples of farmers include small, family farms (&gt;600,000); independent operations; and a few cooperatives (where cocoa is &lt;10% of crop). The initial purchase of cocoa beans is by licensed buyers (LBCs). The Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) and affiliated organizations ensure that quality requirements are linked to sales. Processors and exporters in Ghana include COCOBOD and international companies. This includes those that produce semi-finished goods. The graphic lists similar final steps in the process for both countries. Beans and small family farm products are moved into the global market. Manufacturers further manufacture the products. Retail outlets, restaurants and small businesses serve as customers. And consumers are the final customer.&nbsp;" />
