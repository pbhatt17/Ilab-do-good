The institution accredits auditors under its established standards and is responsible for scheduling and oversight of all audits.

The institution accredits auditors under its established standards and is responsible for scheduling and oversight of all audits.  While this is designed to increase the credibility of the audit, in some sectors or geographic locations, this arrangement may not be available.  In addition, even without a direct financial transaction, some stakeholders may still have concerns about the degree of an auditor’s independence from the audited entity. Varying degrees of independence exist, and independence ultimately needs to be judged on a case-by-case basis."

The institution accredits auditors under its established standards and is responsible for scheduling and oversight of all audits.  While this is designed to increase the credibility of the audit, in some sectors or geographic locations, this arrangement may not be available.  In addition, even without a direct financial transaction, some stakeholders may still have concerns about the degree of an auditor’s independence from the audited entity. Varying degrees of independence exist, and independence ultimately needs to be judged on a case-by-case basis."
